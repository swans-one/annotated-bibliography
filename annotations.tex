\subsubsection{Wool}

\fullcite{howey12}


A dystopian novel. Centers on a number of characters living in a
``Silo.'' These characters do not realized that they are living in a
post apocalyptic world until the protagonist, Juliette, is promotted
to a leadership position within the community. She soon begins to
realize that their silo is not alone.

I rate Wool very positively.
